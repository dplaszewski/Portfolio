## About me
Hello, my name is Dariusz PÅ‚aszewski. I am master of electrical engineering with a specjalization in Lighting Technology. Since my childhood I am interested in information technology. Recently I became interested in software testing. My target for the nearest future is expanding my knowledge and experience in the field of software testing and in the further future I would like to start working with automated testing.
